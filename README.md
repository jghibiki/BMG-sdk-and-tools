# Batman Miniature Game card to TTS Generator

Scrapes [this site](https://gilham.solutions/cards/1) for Batman Miniature Game charcter cards, and
generates a 10 x 7 card sheet set. The sheet sets can then
be uploaded to a hosting source, and then imported into Tabletop Simulator
using the [Custom Deck feature](https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/custom-content/custom-deck/)

Special thanks to `Tobias1087` on the [Arkham Rejects Discord](https://discord.gg/WzZeWzcgua) for implementing the card 
renderer that makes this possible.
